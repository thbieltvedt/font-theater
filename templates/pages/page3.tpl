			<p>Energy Evaluator,</p>
			<p>this forest friendly turbine is for you</p>
			<p>How can you get proven forest site performance  from a new turbine?</p>
			<p>The answer is with the Vestas V112-3.0 MW - our most tested turbine yet.</p>
			<p>The V112-3.0 MW is the result of data collected and anlaysed from over 16000 turbines. Every component has been designed for high performance an d minimal risk, then tested rigorously. And becauce it requires just one service a year, it promises both high availability and low cost of energy.</p>
			<p>With its high tower and new blade profile, it is ideally suited to forest sites in Sweden, producing high output at low and medium wind speeds. This makes it the ideal turbine where space is limited.</p>
			<p> So how do we know the rigorously tested V112-3.0 MW will work so well? We know it will, because we're tried so hard to make it fail.</p>
			<p>To find out how the V112-3.0 MW can meet your needs.</p>
